Future improvements:

* check if it works/how to translate with Python
* check to include the themes (first select the theme, then get the translation exercise)
  ** theme
  ** different tenses, with a random pp
* check to remove some datatables details
* check the sample proba, to get correct verbs not as often selected
* check if i dont put a verb, that it goes to the next one
